My goal was to assist organizations in improving employee retention and performance by creating a comprehensive HR Analytics Dashboard.

- Extracted the client-provided data.
- Loaded the data into Power BI, removed nulls and duplicates, corrected spelling errors, and adjusted data types using Power Query.
- Transformed data loaded into Power View for further analysis.
- Created a logical data structure through the data modeling process, enabling effective analysis and visualization.
- Utilized Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to refine the data, creating calculated measures and columns for advanced analysis.
- Developed user-friendly reports and interactive visualizations through the dashboard.
- Employees aged 26 to 35 exhibit the highest attrition rate.
- Roles in Life Sciences Education and Laboratory Technician domains demonstrate the highest attrition percentages.
- Job satisfaction is directly related to attrition rates across various roles.
- Employees with 1 to 2 years of experience display the highest attrition rates.
- Surprisingly, employees earning below the average salary of 6.5k are more likely to leave the company.
